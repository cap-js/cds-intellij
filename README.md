## Requirements

### Supported IDEs

This plugin is compatible with the latest **paid** IntelliJ IDEs including IDEA Ultimate and WebStorm.  Check https://www.jetbrains.com/ which option is best for you.

> The LSP API is only available in the commercial versions JetBrains' IDEs, which is why the plugin doesn't run in the free variants.

### Logs

To aid support, please include relevant log files in your report.
Depending on the kind of problem encountered, you may want to include the logs from the **IDE**, the **LSP client** and/or the **LSP server**.

#### IDE Logs

Logs produced by the IDE can be found by opening the *Help* menu and selecting *Show Log in <platform-dependent tool>*.
See [Locating IDE log files](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/207241085-Locating-IDE-log-files) for more information.

#### Language Server Protocol (LSP) Logs

Logging of the stdio communication between the LSP client and server (i.e., the protocol messages) can be activated by modifying your IDE's `vmoptions` file:
- Edit the file specific to your IntelliJ installation by opening the IDE and going to *Help > Edit Custom VM Options...*.
- Add the following line:
```
-DDEBUG=cds-lsp
```

Alternatively, set the following environment variable for your IDE:
```
DEBUG=cds-lsp
```

These settings will also enable debug logging for the LSP server.

After restarting the IDE, find the logs in the [plugin directory](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544519-Directories-used-by-the-IDE-to-store-settings-caches-plugins-and-logs), at `lib/cds-lsp/stdio.json`.

#### LSP Client Logs

To include the logs produced by the LSP client (part of the IDE), you need to enable the corresponding setting in the IDE:
- Open the *Help* menu and select *Diagnostic Tools > Debug Log Settingsâ€¦*.
- In the dialog that opens, add the following line:
```
#com.intellij.platform.lsp
```
- Click *OK* to save the settings.

#### LSP Server Logs

The LSP server logs to its own file, which you can locate by opening your system temporary directory, then the sub-folder `cdxlsp`, and finally heading to the file most recently modified at the time of the reported problem.

Hint: depending on your operating system, the temporary directory may be at one of the following locations:

| OS           | Default location                        | Environment variables | Command                            |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Windows      | C:\Users\\[username]\AppData\Local\Temp | %TEMP%                |                                    |
| macOS, Linux | /tmp                                    | $TMPDIR               | node -e "console.log(os.tmpdir())" |
