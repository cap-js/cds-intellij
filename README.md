### Foundations

intellij-cds is based on the following components:

| Component                                                                                       | Role                                                                             | Publisher              |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| [CDS Language Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/cds-lsp) (cds-lsp, running on Node.js) | CDS language support                                                             | SAP                    |
| CDS TextMate bundle                                                                             | CDS syntax highlighting                                                          | (shipped with cds-lsp) |
| [IntelliJ LSP API](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/language-server-protocol.html)   | [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) support in IntelliJ | JetBrains              |

#### Terms

- Language servers: provide language-specific features like code completion, diagnostics, etc.
- Language Server Protocol (LSP): common protocol for communication between IDEs and language servers.


## Requirements

### Supported IDEs
The intellij-cds plugin is compatible with the latest **paid** IntelliJ IDEs including IDEA Ultimate and WebStorm (due to the restricted availability of JetBrains' LSP API).

### Operating Systems

## How to obtain support
[Create an issue](https://github.com/cap-js/cds-intellij/issues) in this repository if you find a bug or have questions about the content.

For additional support, [ask a question in SAP Community](https://answers.sap.com/questions/ask.html).

### Known Issues

ðŸš« CDS Language Support for IntelliJ is not compatible with non-commercial IntelliJ IDEs, such as IntelliJ Community Edition. This is due to the fact that intellij-cds relies on the IntelliJ LSP API, which is only available in commercial IDEs.

### Logs

To aid support, please include relevant log files in your report.
Depending on the kind of problem encountered, you may want to include the logs from the **IDE**, the **LSP client** and/or the **LSP server**.

#### IDE Logs
Logs produced by the IDE can be found by opening the *Help* menu and selecting *Show Log in <platform-dependent tool>*.
See [here](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/207241085-Locating-IDE-log-files) for more information.

#### LSP Logs
Logging of the stdio communication between the LSP client and server (i.e., the protocol messages) can be activated by modifying your IDE's `vmoptions` file:
- Edit the file specific to your IntelliJ installation by opening the IDE and going to *Help > Edit Custom VM Options...*.
- Add the following line:
```
-DDEBUG=cds-lsp
```

Alternatively, set the following environment variable for your IDE:
```
DEBUG=cds-lsp
```

After restarting the IDE, find the logs in the [plugin directory](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544519-Directories-used-by-the-IDE-to-store-settings-caches-plugins-and-logs),
subdirectory `lib/cds-lsp`, file `stdio.log`.

#### LSP Client Logs
To include the logs produced by the LSP client (part of the IDE), you need to enable the corresponding setting in the IDE:
- Open the *Help* menu and select *Diagnostic Tools > Debug Log Settingsâ€¦*.
- In the dialog that opens, add the following line:
```
#com.intellij.platform.lsp
```
- Click *OK* to save the settings.

#### LSP Server Logs
The LSP server logs to its own file, which you can locate by opening your system temporary directory, then the sub-folder `cdxlsp`, and finally heading to the file most recently modified at the time of the reported problem.

Hint: depending on your operating system, the temporary directory may be at one of the following locations:

| OS           | Default location                        | Environment variables | Command                            |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Windows      | C:\Users\\[username]\AppData\Local\Temp | %TEMP%                |                                    |
| macOS, Linux | /tmp                                    | $TMPDIR               | node -e "console.log(os.tmpdir())" |
